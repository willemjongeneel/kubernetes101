# Episode 2 - Containers

### Why Containers?
- IT WORKS on my machine
- it works on my machine, then we'll ship your machine, and that is how docker was born
- portable - Build in one place, move it to another machine
- isolated - Containers are isolated from eachother 
- consistent - everytime you deploy it, it will be exactly the sAME
- lightweight
- build once, deploy anywhere
